    | This is a list of relationships for use with relationship tracking for people.
    | More types can be added at will, and can be removed -IF- they are not currently
    | in use -AND- are below the marked point-- otherwise doing so will cause errors.
    |
    | Types after the marked point are largely present for convenience, and function
    | more or less like entering in a custom type, but adding frequently types may
    | be useful/efficient since custom types must be entered in each time.
    |
    | Note that keys MUST BE UNIQUE WITHIN THIS FILE. It does not matter if they are
    | in different groups.
