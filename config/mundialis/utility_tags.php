    | Utility Tags
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This is a list of utility tags that can be applied to pages and for which
    | maintenance reports can be viewed. These are used primarily for maintenance
    | functions and indicators, e.g. on-page alerts to indicate WIP pages, stubs,
    | etc., versus regular tags which are used for content organization.
    |
    | This file can be fairly safely customized and tags added/removed at will.
    | Make sure to follow the same formatting as the existing entries and include
    | all properties present in them, as they are all required.
    | Nonetheless, it's recommended not to have too many tags here. Also take care
    | to avoid any added tags' keys conflicting with existing special page routes.
